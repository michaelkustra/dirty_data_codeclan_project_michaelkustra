# Question 1
# What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)

```{r}

long_clean_candy_data %>% 
  select(ratings) %>% 
  summarise(num_ratings = sum(!is.na(ratings)))

```

The total number of candy ratings across the three years (excluding any NAs)
